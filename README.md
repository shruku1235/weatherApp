Hi! This is the frontend I designed for a weather app, and resembles pretty similarly my high-fidelity prototype.

Resources I used:
  - Slides from the Studio session
  - The Github repos that were shared with us in class
  - ChatGPT to generate boilerplate code such as the head section in index.html and to answer specific syntax
    questions about adjusting height/width/images etc
  - Pictures downloaded from the internet for icons used
  - The map is a screenshot from Apple weather

All of the customizations/creation of components were done by me, and I understand the function of every part
of my code.
